i would like to highlight the importance of labours and why they are the fundamental and faundation of our society and the difficulties they 
face first of all there are 2 peoples who make up an institution or workplace i.e a profetional and a labour these 2 people work to gether 
to create a building a structure a monument a plan or anything for eg if we where to construct a buildind in that we would first require a 
civil eng a mechanical eng an electrical eng an architecture these r the main profetional that would require in constructing the building 
and the most fundamental part for construction will be the labours . labours would actually execute the plan . The c eng e eng will make the
 layout make the plan but the execution is done by the labours in a vehical production electrical eng mechanical eng and many more are 
required but without the labour car plan cannot be executed if we were to make the bridge in that diff profetionals are required and then the
 labours they execute tha plan ther difficulties the labours faces is that if an engineerworks for an extra time they are given more payment but
 you see when a labour works for more time given by the government they are not payed more and also the labors are given less wages
